                    <p>MacBook Pro is one of the best laptop in the 2017 market. Paper specs look weak for the price, but the overall experience is very good. MacBook Pro has the best build quality. The machining on this thing is fantastic, and all the moving parts are very well fitted. Structurally, it is rock solid as well.</p>
                    <p>Without a doubt, Apple has the best customer service in the industry. They are far from perfect, in fact this particular MacBook is basically irreparable outside of Apple. But, I think their customer service is really good. If you need absolutely amazing customer service, go for Apple.</p>
                    <p>The second-gen butterfly switches on the MacBook are better than the first gen, but they are not perfect. In terms of trackpads, the MacBook trackpad is king. It is big, has the Taptic Engine so you can click anywhere, tracking is dead accurate and clicking feels awesome. Speakers on the MacBook Pro are by far the best. The loudest, the clearest, the best bass. However, MacBook pro is the worst for the ports because there are only two Thunderbolt 3 ports. The MacBook Pro does not have ultra thin bezels, but the display panel itself is the best. It is lower resolution than the XPS 13, but it gets very bright. Plus, the colour gamut and accuracy is really good. (480 nt, RGB 99%). </p>
                    <p>The MacBook Pro storage is technically upgradeable, but it's proprietary. Fortunately, it is already very fast. The fans on the MacBook Pro on idle are essentially silent. When it is under load, it is pretty quiet still and that is one advantage of duel-core CPUs. Thermally, it is very comfortable to use under load and I would not worry about thermal issues on this laptop at all. The MacBook has the best battery (54.5 Wh) life at over 10 hours of regular use, 9 hours of streaming 4k videos. Apple laptops traditionally had much bigger batteries, but in tuning down its size, the battery is smaller.</p>
                    <p>Dispite the paper specs looking a little lame, it is actually a very solid device. Great build quality, fantastic screen, speakers, and trackpad. But what is not great is obviously the price tag, and for this price, it is not that it is an overpriced machine. It is kind of Apple premium pricing, but you are forced to purchase things in this system that you normally may not want to purchase, or you may not need. So, like the super wide gamut screen and the fantastic speakers, you are forced to buy into this system just because it has the "Pro" moniker. Now, dongles, adapters, proprietary storage drives, these are all kind of designed to generate revenue for Apple. I get that, but as a consumer, we kind of get screwed for it. However, it is clear that this is one of the best laptops in 2017 markets.</p>
