                    <p>CPU: Intel Core i7 | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 | RAM: 16GB | Screen: 13.3-inch, QHD (3,200 x 1,800) Touch Screen | Storage: 256GB – 1TB SSD (PCIe M.2)

                <div class="review">
                    <p>For the first time since its debut, the Blade Stealth sees a noticeable exterior design change. The screen has increased from 12.5 inches to 13.3 inches, but the body size has stayed the same. The touch display is gorgeous. A 0.8-inch diagonal increase isn't a big number on its own, but it makes a difference at this size, and the laptop is better for it, especially since it doesn't increase the chassis size. The resolution is QHD+ (3,200 by 1,800), and like many Razer systems, uses IGZO technology for brighter and more vibrant colors, and it shows. The display is extremely crisp and colorful, making it a joy to use. It's a little reflective under bright lighting, but I prefer that to a duller matte finish, and it has fairly wide viewing angles.</p>
                    <p>It's hard to miss the lighting on many Razer products—whether on peripherals or computers, multi-colored LEDs dubbed Chroma have in many ways become the company's calling card. The color is provided here in spades by the keyboard, with each key once again individually backlit. That means you can have them all glow and shift in unison, select a wave or ripple effect, or make each key (or groups of keys) separate changing or static colors. As for the keys themselves, the typing experience is comfortable. It feels like there's a bit more travel this time around (I dinged the last model for somewhat shallow-feeling keys), so typing on this laptop for an extended period is a breeze. The metal touchpad is smooth and responsive, one of my favorites around. The speakers produce clear sound and don't distort at the highest levels, though their maximum volume is hardly booming </p>
                    <p>Port options aren't too numerous, but most bases are covered. The left side holds a USB 3.0 port, the headphone jack, and a USB-C port with Thunderbolt 3, which also serves as the charging port. On the right, there's another USB 3.0 port and an HDMI port for connecting to other displays. That's enough to get file transfer and multi-screen done, and the USB-C functionality is there, albeit not while charging at the same time. It is helpful, though, that the Stealth doesn't inconveniently opt for only USB-C, like we see on some of the slimmer ultraportables, including the 2017 Apple MacBook. The laptop also includes Killer wireless (dual-band 802.11ac), Bluetooth 4.1, and is covered by a one-year warranty.</p>
                    <p>Since the Stealth is the rare non-gaming computer in Razer's lineup, its integrated graphics-driven 3D performance was lackluster. That's par for the course for ultraportables, which forgo discrete graphics cards (and their requisite cooling components) to be the lightest and thinnest around. As such, you can expect to play low-lift or simpler 2D games moderately well, but any high-end 3D games are mostly out of the question. Any video or rendering work that benefits from a graphics card will be slower and frustrating, so don't look to this laptop as a workstation. Battery life is solid, if not spectacular. It lasted for 7 hours.</p>
                    <p>The newest Razer Blade Stealth is undoubtedly one of the most attractive options on the market, and for less money than other premium laptops. The 13.3-inch screen size looks stunning and elevates an already-great metal design, the keyboard is customizable, and it's a quick performer. The Dell XPS 13 Touch (Rose Gold Edition) arguably has a bit more premium of a build, and avoids some of the small complaints I have with the Stealth (slightly longer battery, you don't have to unplug the charger to use USB-C) but it's also $250 more as tested. Given that the Stealth offers a brilliant screen at the same resolution and many shared features, it's unparalleled for value in the high-end price tier.</p>
