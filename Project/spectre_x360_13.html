                    <p>A true ultraportable, the Spectre x360 13 is seriously slim and light. The same was true of the first iteration, and its only slimmed down from there. The 2015 model measured 0.63 by 12.79 by 8.6 inches (HWD) and weighed 3.26 pounds, the 2016 model was 0.5 by 12 by 8.6 inches and 2.8 pounds, and this year's version is minimally slighter at 0.5 by 12 by 8.5 inches and 2.8 pounds. Overall, the new design and color scheme with the slender profile make for a killer look.</p>
                    <p>Convertibility is where the Spectre x360 separates itself from the Spectre 13. The laptop is able to fully transform into a Windows 10 tablet thanks to its hinge. Some systems are a bit too big, thick, or unwieldy to be used as in Tablet mode, but since the x360 is so thin and small, it feels natural to hold that way. This makes it easier to carry around in one hand, good for quickly showing off a design to a colleague nearby, or handing over to a coworker to get a better look at some data. You can also flip it into Tent or Display mode to show off the screen on a desk or table to a gathered group, though the 13-inch screen is a bit small to see if you're too far away.</p>
                    <p>The keyboard cuts a fairly low profile, which prevents it from feeling awkward when you grip the backside of the laptop in Tablet mode. Despite the thin build, the keys still feel good to type on, offering more travel than, say, the Razer Blade Stealth's keyboard, which feels a bit shallow. The keyboard offers satisfying feedback, like last year's model, but the new color scheme avoids the previous gray-on-gray keycap lettering issue, which made it hard to read in some instances. The keys are also backlit with white lighting, and you can toggle the lights on or off as needed. The touchpad tracks very smoothly, and while it's not too tall because of limited space, it's nice and wide and still feels roomy. The Bang and Olufsen speakers provide admirable volume and sound quality, particularly given the laptop's size. It's no home theater setup, of course, but you can comfortably play video or music and hear it across the room, with little to no distortion at maximum volume.</p>
                    <p>You don't get a ton of connectivity options given the X360's size, but the essentials are covered. The left panel holds the Power button, a USB 2.0 port, and the headphone jack, while the right side has the Volume rocker and two USB-C ports, each with Thunderbolt 3 and capable of charging the laptop. There's no base video ports like HDMI or DisplayPort, but with adapters for the USB-C ports you can connect any display you'd like. One more USB 3.0 port would have been useful so you can connect an additional peripheral, but again, an adapter in the USB-C port should have you covered. At the same time, including any USB 3.0 ports at all is appreciated, given some of the recent super-thin laptops that limit you to USB-C only, like the latest Apple MacBook.</p>
                    <p>Despite its small size, the x360 is quite fast. The 2.7GHz Core i7-7500U processor, SSD, and 16GB of memory make for snappy load times across the board. The PCMark 8 Work Conventional test shows a score slightly low than similar competition, mainly because the 4K display is more demanding that most. That does reflect some power loss in real-world use, but it's fairly negligible in day-to-day work. The multimedia scores back up those claims, showing fast times that compare favorably with the competition. Since the processor (and by extentsion, the integrated graphics) is the same as in last year's Spectre x360 13, the performance numbers are virtually identical, save for where the 4K screen adds extra strain.</p>
                    <p>Given the lack of discrete graphics, the x360 13 doesn't have much in the way of 3D power or gaming chops. You could get away with some Low- or Medium-setting games at a low resolution, but even playing at HD with modern titles is out of reach. That's not unique by any means—almost every ultraportable or 2-in-1 packs integrated graphics, since the emphasis is on slim and light form over gaming prowess. The expensive Microsoft Surface Book is an exception here, but you'll have to pay a pretty penny for the discrete graphics version.</p>
                    <p>The HP Spectre x360 13 fulfills its mission very well, coming together as a slick, versatile, travel-friendly convertible laptop that performs admirably. The 4K display looks excellent, making it very appealing even if it comes with some drawbacks. You'll turn heads with the Spectre X360 13's stylish design, and there are few machines I'd rather travel with more given the whole package. Save for the reduced battery life, the 2017 Spectre x360 improves on its predecessor, making it our top pick for high-end convertible laptops. If you'd like to spend less for a speedy, well-designed convertible laptop with long battery life, the Lenovo Yoga 910 is our top midrange pick, though opting for a 4K screen brings the price up to the same as the Spectre's x360 13.</p>
