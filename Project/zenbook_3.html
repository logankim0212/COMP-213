                    <p>The design of the Asus ZenBook 3 is as close as you can get to that of the Apple MacBook without laser cutting an Apple logo into its slick aerospace-grade aluminum body. It's less than half an inch thick, but it doesn't skimp on computing power with an Intel 7th Generation Intel Core i7 processor. The laptop's dimensions are 0.47 by 11.65 by 7.53 inches (HWD), and it weighs only 1.97 pounds. The ZenBook 3 is more portable than the Dell XPS 13 Touch, and thinner and lighter than the Apple MacBook or Apple MacBook Air 13-inch. </p>
                    <p>The 12.5-inch full HD (1,920-by-1,080) screen is one of the highlights. It is bright and colorful, but not quite as high resolution as the screens on the MacBook (2,304 by 1,440) or the XPS 13 Touch (3,200 by 1,800), but it is certainly enough for most day-to-day situations. The 12.5-inch full HD (1,920-by-1,080) screen is one of the highlights. It is bright and colorful, but not quite as high resolution as the screens on the MacBook (2,304 by 1,440) or the XPS 13 Touch (3,200 by 1,800), but it is certainly enough for most day-to-day situations.</p>
                    <p>Like the 12-inch MacBook, the ZenBook 3 only has a single USB-C port on the right side, and there's a headset jack on the left. There seemingly isn't a lot of space for much else, though the HP Spectre 13 has three USB-C ports and it's even slimmer. One other technology that's missing from the ZenBook 3 is Thunderbolt 3, which both the HP Spectre 13 and the Dell XPS 13 Touch include. Thunderbolt 3 is far from a requirement, but it is nice to have, particularly if you're going to be transferring large files like Raw photos or 4K videos. The single USB-C port is also the port for the included charger, so you can't connect a USB-C drive and the charger at the same time. It's not all dark clouds, since Asus does include a mini dock with a USB 3.1 Type-A port and an HDMI jack in addition to a USB-C port that can only be used with the charger. Apple charges $79 for the MacBook AV adapter that does the same job. It's less convenient than the XPS 13 Touch, but at least it gives you connectors for traditional hard drives and HD displays.</p>
                    <p>The 512GB SSD and 16GB of RAM are both generous, and should serve you well for several years. That large amount of memory is beneficial for multitasking and working on multimedia projects, and after all, that's why you'd consider a Core i7 machine over one running a Core i3 or i5. This configuration comes with Windows 10 Pro, so it will work well as an executive's laptop, since it will easily interface with your company's file and login servers. The ZenBook 3 comes with a one-year warranty.</p>
                    <p>With the ZenBook 3, Asus has shrunk the Core i7 laptop to amazingly slender proportions—only the HP Spectre 13 is thinner. Though the ZenBook 3 costs a few hundred dollars more than the Spectre, it bests it on every spec and performance measure, except for port selection. It's certainly faster and more comfortable to type on than the Apple MacBook, and it lasts longer on a battery charge, though the MacBook has a higher-resolution screen.</p>
                    <p>The Dell XPS 13 Touch is a different animal, as it has a closer price, a much higher-resolution touch screen, and better connectivity (two USB 3.0 ports, a USB-C port with Thunderbolt, and an SD card reader), but a lower-performing processor, less storage, and less memory. The Gold edition of the XPS 13 Touch carries a $150 price premium over the ZenBook 3, but the former's Core i7 processor and integrated graphics are the only improvements over the silver model. The ZenBook 3 meets or exceeds our expectations for premium ultraportables: speed, endurance, thinness, light weight, advanced technology, a beautiful screen, comfortable typing, visual presence/aesthetics, and build quality.</p>
